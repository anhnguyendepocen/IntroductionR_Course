There is extraordinary demand for this course.

To accomodate this demand, we opened a second session.

If you would like to switch sessions, go to the Doodle Link on the right (also on the webpage) and include your contact information.

If a Session 1 and Session 2 student agree to switch, write me and I'll make the change.

### Who is this guy?

Dr. Nathaniel D. Phillips, American


Post-doctoral researcher at Economic Psychology. 

Research: Judgment and decision making, risky choice, machine learning.

6 years ago I had never used R. Since then I use it almost every day. 

Sometimes all day.

...

I love it.

<font size=5>This is a "Flipped Classroom"</font>

At home: Read book chapters, watch YouTube videos, and do practice problems.

In class: Work *together* on Weekly Programming Assignments (WPAs)

## In-class WPAs

.pull-left4[

Several programming tasks. Both simple and challenging.

Work together. Ask for help. Do as much as you can.

Try to reach the **Checkpoint** to make sure you aren't falling behind.

After 1.5 hours, submit *whatever* you have completed. You'll get 100% credit. Every time. No questions asked.

## Work together!

.pull-left3[

The best way to learn programming is to work together!

Ask for help, teach each other.

Write your own code, submit your own assignment.

|----|:---------------------------------|
| 1 |      I have **absolutely no** idea what I'm supposed to do! Help!   |
|     2| I know what I'm supposed to do but I don't know how to get started. Help!     |
|     3|    My code should be working but it's not! R must be broken! Help!     |
|     4|    My code works but I don't know why...Help!     |
|     5|    I think I got it, but is there a better way to solve this task? Help!    |

## Final Project

<br>
<br>

At the end of the course, you'll complete a final analysis project.

Use **any** dataset you want (or I'll give you one).

Show off your R skills, discover new techniques for your data.

Last 2 / 3 weeks of class are for in-class project work. Get help!

...More details later in the semester

## Grading

.pull-left3[

Pass / Fail course

If you miss a class, email me, do the WPA at home and submit as soon as you can.

If you adopt a growth mindset, ask questions, challenge yourself, do your WPAs, and submit a final project, you'll pass.

This will be a fun class. Don't worry about your grade, focus on learning R!
