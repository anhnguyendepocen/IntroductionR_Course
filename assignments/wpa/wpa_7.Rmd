## Facebook Attraction

<img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_MJBBFCOksCY/S_jHGyMkoUI/AAAAAAAAAA0/-DnFV_1bu1Y/s1600/Douche.jpg" style="height:400px;" />


In this WPA, you will analyze data from a (again...fake) study on attraction. In the study, 1000 heterosexual University students viewed the Facebook profile of another student (the "target") of the opposite sex. Based on a target's profile, each participant made three judgments about the target - intelligence, attractiveness, and dateability. The primary judgement was a *dateability* rating indicating how dateable the person was on a scale of 0 to 100.

  }
  
  return(x)

```


```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
facebook <- read.table("http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
```


The data are located in a tab-delimited text file at http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook.txt. Here is how the first few rows of the data should look:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
head(facebook)
```

## Datafile description

The data file has 1000 rows and 10 columns. Here are the columns

- `session`: The experiment session in which the study was run. There were 50 total sessions.

- `sex`: The sex of the target

- `age`: The age of the target

- `haircolor`: The haircolor of the target

- `university`: The university that the target attended.

- `education`: The highest level of education obtained by the target.

- `shirtless`: Did the target have a shirtless profile picture? 1.No v 2.Yes

- `intelligence`: How intelligent do you find this target? 1.Low, 2.Medium, 3.High

- `attractiveness`: How physically attractive do you find this target? 1.Low, 2.Medium, 3.High

- `dateability`: How dateable is this target? 0 to 100.

## Data loading and preparation

1. Open your class R project. Open a new script and enter your name, date, and the wpa number at the top. Save the script in the `R` folder in your project working directory as `wpa_7_LASTFIRST.R`, where LAST and FIRST are your last and first names. 

2. The data are stored in a tab--delimited text file located at http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook.txt. Using `read.table()` load this data into R as a new object called `facebook`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
facebook <- read.table("http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook.txt", 
                       sep = "\t", 
                       header = TRUE)
```


## Understand the data

3. Look at the first few rows of the dataframe with the `head()` function to make sure it loaded correctly.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
head(facebook)
```

4. Using the `str()` function, look at the structure of the dataframe to make sure everything looks ok

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
str(facebook)
```

## Answer guidelines Read carefully to save yourself time!

- For each question, conduct the appropriate ANOVA. Write the conclusion in APA style. To summarize an effect in an ANOVA, use the format F(XXX, YYY) = FFF, p = PPP, where XXX is the degrees of freedom of the variable you are testing, YYY is the degrees of freedom of the residuals, FFF is the F value for the variable you are testing, and PPP is the p-value. If the p-value is less than .01, just write p < .01.

- If the p-value of the ANOVA is less than .05, conduct post-hoc tests. If you are only testing one independent variable, write APA conclusions for the post-hoc test. **If you are testing more than one independent variable in your ANOVA, you do not need to write APA style conclusions for post-hoc tests -- just print the result.**

For example, here is how I would analyze and answer the question: "Was there an effect of diets on Chicken Weights?""

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# ANOVA on Chicken Weights
#   IV = Diet, DV = weight

# ANOVA
p0.aov <- aov(formula = weight ~ Diet,
            data = ChickWeight)

summary(p0.aov)

# ANOVA was significant (p < .01), so I'll conduct post-hoc tests

# Tukey post-hoc tests
TukeyHSD(p0.aov)
```

*Answer: There was a significant main effect of diets on chicken weights (F(3, 574) = 10.81, p < .01). Pairwise Tukey HSD tests showed significant differences between diets 1 and 3 (diff = 40.30, p < .01) and diets 1 and 4 (diff = 32.62, p < .01). All other pairwise differences were not significant at the 0.05 significance threshold.*


## One-way ANOVAS

5. Was there a main effect of the university on dateability? Conduct a one-way ANOVA. If the result is significant (p < .05), conduct post-hoc tests

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
p5.aov <- aov(formula = dateability ~ university,
            data = facebook)

summary(p5.aov)

TukeyHSD(p5.aov)

#Answer: There was a significant main effect of university on dateability (F(2, 997) = 13.99, p < .01). Pairwise Tukey HSD tests showed significant differences between Zurich and Basel (diff = -10.27, p < .01) and Geneva and Basel (diff = -8.64, p < .01). All other pairwise differences were not significant at the 0.05 significance threshold.*
```



6. Was there a main effect of intelligence on dateability? Conduct a one-way ANOVA. If the result is significant (p < .05), conduct post-hoc tests

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
p6.aov <- aov(formula = dateability ~ intelligence,
            data = facebook)

summary(p6.aov)

TukeyHSD(p6.aov)

# *Answer: There was a significant main effect of intelligence on dateability (F(2, 997) = 4.97, p < .01). Pairwise Tukey HSD tests showed significant differences between Medium and Low intelligence (diff = 6.53, p < .01). All other pairwise differences were not significant at the 0.05 significance threshold.*
```



7. Was there a main effect of haircolor on dateability? Conduct a one-way ANOVA. If the result is significant (p < .05), conduct post-hoc tests

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
p7.aov <- aov(formula = dateability ~ haircolor,
            data = facebook)

summary(p7.aov)

# *Answer: There was no significant main effect of haircolor on dateability (F(2, 997) = 1.23, p = 0.29).*
```



## Multi-independent ANOVAs

8. Conduct a three-way ANOVA on dateability with both intelligence, university and haircolor as IVs. Do your results for each variable change compared to your previous one-way ANOVAs on these variables? (You do not need to give APA results or conduct post-hoc tests, just answer the question verbally).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
p8.aov <- aov(formula = dateability ~ intelligence + university + haircolor,
            data = facebook)

summary(p8.aov)

# *Answer: Yes the results are the same!*
```



9. Conduct a multi-way anova including sex, haircolor, university, education, shirtless, intelligence and attractiveness as independent variables predicting dateability. WHich variables are significantly related to dateability? (*Do* write APA results for each variable but do *not* conduct post-hoc tests).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
p9.aov <- aov(formula = dateability ~ sex + haircolor + university + education + shirtless + intelligence + attractiveness,
            data = facebook)

summary(p9.aov)

# *Answer: There were significant effects of sex (F(1, 986) = 66.10, p < .01), university (F(2, 986) = 17.35, p < .01), intelligence (F(2, 986) = 5.34, p < .01) and attractiveness (F(2, 986) = 101.87, p < .01).*
```



### ANOVAs on subsets of data

10. It turns out that the experimenter who ran sessions 1 through 30 (a man) was trying to score a date and slipped in his own profile picture into the study. We can't trust these data. Repeat your multi anova from question 9 ONLY for sessions 31 through 50. Do your conclusions change compared to when you analyzed the data from all sessions?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
p10.aov <- aov(formula = dateability ~ sex + haircolor + university + education + shirtless + intelligence + attractiveness,
            data = subset(facebook, session > 30))

summary(p10.aov)

# The results look the same
```


## Interactions

11. Create a plot (e.g.; `pirateplot()`, `barplot()`, `boxplot()`) showing the distribution of dateability based on two independent variables: sex and shirtless. Based on what you see in the plot, do you expect there to be an interaction between sex and shirtless? Why or why not?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(yarrr)
pirateplot(dateability ~ sex + shirtless, 
           data = facebook)

# Yes there looks like an intereaction!
```


12.  Test your prediction with the appropriate ANOVA
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
p12.aov <- aov(dateability ~ sex * shirtless, 
            data = facebook)
            
summary(p12.aov)

# Yep I was right!
```


# CHECKPOINT!

### More interactions

13. Create a plot (e.g.; `pirateplot()`, `barplot()`, `boxplot()`) showing the distribution of dateability based on two independent variables: university and education Based on what you see in the plot, do you expect there to be an interaction between university and education? Why or why not?

```{r}
pirateplot(dateability ~ shirtless + sex, 
           data = facebook)

# Yes there looks like an interaction!
```

14. Test your prediction with the appropriate ANOVA

```{r}
p14.aov <- aov(dateability ~ shirtless * sex, 
               data = facebook)

summary(p14.aov)

# I was right again!
```
    
    
15. Create a plot (e.g.; `pirateplot()`, `barplot()`, `boxplot()`) showing the distribution of dateability based on two independent variables: university and haircolor. Based on what you see in the plot, do you expect there to be an interaction between university and intelligence? Why or why not?

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
pirateplot(dateability ~ university + haircolor, 
           data = facebook)

# There does not look like an interaction
```

16. Test your prediction with the appropriate ANOVA

```{r}
p22.aov <- aov(dateability ~ university * haircolor, 
           data = facebook)

summary(p22.aov)

# Yep! no significant interaction!
```
