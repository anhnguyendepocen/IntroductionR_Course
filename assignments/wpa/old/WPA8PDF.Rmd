## Student Performance

<img src="http://www.funnfun.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/love-for-study-funny-student-450x329.jpg" style="height:400px;" />



In this WPA, you will analyze data from a study on student performance in two classes: math and Portugese. These data come from the UCI Machine Learning database at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#

Here is the data description (taken directly from the original website

*This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).*

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
student.math <- read.table("http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/studentmath.txt",
                      sep = "\t",
                      header = T
                      )

student.por <- read.table("http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/studentpor.txt",
                      sep = "\t",
                      header = T
                      )
```

The data are located in two tab-delimited text files at http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/studentmath.txt (the math data), and http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/studentpor.txt (the portugese data).

Here is how the first few rows of the math data should look:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(student.math)
```

# Data loading and preparation

1. Open an R poject and open a new script. Save the script with the name `wpa_8_LastFirst.R`.

2. Using `read.table()`, load the tab-delimited text file containing the data into R and assign them to new objects called `student.math` and `student.por` respectively.

```{r}
student.math <- read.table("http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/studentmath.txt",
                      sep = "\t",
                      header = T
                      )

student.por <- read.table("http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/studentpor.txt",
                      sep = "\t",
                      header = T
                      )
```

# Understand the data

3. Look at the first few rows of the dataframes with the `head()` function to make sure they were imported correctly.

```{r}
head(student.math)

head(student.por)
```


4. Using the `str()` function, look at summary statistics for each column in the dataframe. There should be 33 columsn in each dataset. Make sure everything looks ok.

```{r}
str(student.math)

str(student.por)
```


# Standard Regression with lm()

## One IV

5. For the math data, create a regression object called `lm.5` predicting first period grade (G1) based on age.

```{r}
lm.5 <- lm(G1 ~ age, data = student.math)
```

6. How do you interpret the relationship between age and first period grade?

```{r}
# There is a slight negative relationship between age and first period grade (b = -0.17), however the relationship is not significant
```

7. For the math data, create a regression object called `lm.7` predicting first period grade (G1) based on absences

```{r}
lm.7 <- lm(G1 ~ absences, data = student.math)
```

8. How do you interpret the relationship between absences and G1?

```{r}
# There is a slight negative relationship between absences and first period grade (b = -0.01), however the relationship is not significant
```

9. For the math data, create a regression object called `lm.9` predicting each student's period 3 grade (G3) based on their period 1 grade (G1)

```{r}
lm.9 <- lm(G3 ~ G1, data = student.math)
```

10. How do you determine the relationship between G1 and G3?

```{r}
# There is a strong positive relationship between first period grade and third period grade (b = 1.1, p < .01)
```

# Adding a regression line to a scatterplot

11. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between G1 and G3 for the math data.

```{r}
plot(x = student.math$G1,
     y = student.math$G3)
```

12. Add a regression line to the scatterplot from your regression object `lm.9` (hint: use `abline()`).

```{r}
plot(x = student.math$G1,
     y = student.math$G3)

abline(lm.9)
```


# Multiple IVs

13. For the math data, create a regression object called `lm.13` predicting third period grade (G3) based on sex, age, internet, and failures

```{r}
lm.13 <- lm(G3 ~ sex + age + internet + failures, data = student.math)
```


14. How do you interpret the regression output? Which variables are significantly related to third period grade?

```{r}
# sex and failures predict third period grade. Men perform better than women, and the more failures a person has the lower their grade.
```

# Checkpoint!!!

15. Create a new regression object called `lm.15` using the same variables as question 13 (the model was `lm.13` where you predicted third period grade (G3) based on sex, age, internet, and failures): however, this time use the portugese dataset to fit the model.

```{r}
lm.15 <- lm(G3 ~ sex + age + internet + failures, data = student.por)
```

16. What are the key differences between the beta values for the portugese dataset (`lm.15`) and the math dataset (`lm.13`)?

```{r}
# in the portugese datset, men do worse than women, and internet actually helps performance!
```


# Predicting values

17. For the math dataset, create a regression object called `lm.17` predicting a student's first period grade (G1) based on all variables in the dataset (Hint: use the notation `formula = y ~ .` to include all variables!

```{r}
lm.17 <- lm(absences ~., 
            data = student.math)
```

18. Save the fitted values values from the `lm.17` object as a vector called `lm.17.fitted` (Hint: `model$fitted.values`)

```{r}
lm.17.fitted <- lm.17$fitted.values
```

19. For the math dataset, create a scatterplot showing the relationship between a student's first period grade (G1) and the fitted values from the model. Does the model appear to correctly fit a student's first period grade?

```{r}
plot(student.math$G1, 
     lm.17.fitted)

# No, the model doesn't seem to do that great of a job
```
