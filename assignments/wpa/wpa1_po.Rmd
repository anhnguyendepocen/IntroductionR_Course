Open a new R script in R and save it as `wpa_X_LastFirst.R` (where Last and First is your last and first name). At the top of your script, write the assignment number, your name and date in comments. When you answer a task, indicate which task you are answering with appopriate comments.

*Here is an example of how your `wpa_X_LastFirst.R` file could look*
```{r, eval = F}
# Assignment: WPA X
# Name: LAST, FIRST
# Date: X MONTH YEAR


# TASK 1
1 + 1

# TASK 2
# Draw 100 samples from a standard normal
x <- rnorm(100)
# Conduct a t-test
t.test(x)

# Does drinking non-alcoholic beer affect cognitive performance?

<img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02326/obama_2326627b.jpg" width="400" />

A psychologist has a theory that some of the negative cognitive effects of alcohol are the result of psychological rather than physiological processes. To test this, she has 12 participants perform a cognitive test before and after drinking non-alcoholic beer which was labelled to contain 5\% alcohol. Results from the study, including some demographic data, are presented in the following table. Note that higher scores on the test indicate better performance.

participant | before  | after | age | sex | eye.color
----| ------ | ------- | ---- | ---- | ----
1 | 45 | 43 | 20 | male | blue
2 | 49 | 50 | 19 | female | blue
3 | 40 | 61 | 22 | male | brown
4 | 48 | 44 | 20 | female | brown
5 | 44 | 45 | 27 | male | blue
6 | 70 | 20 | 22 | female | blue
7 | 90 | 85 | 22 | male | brown
8 | 75 | 65 | 20 | female | brown
9 | 80 | 72 | 25 | male | blue
10| 65 | 65 | 22 | female | blue
11 | 80 | 70 | 24 | male | brown
12 | 52 | 75 | 22 | female | brown


## Creating vectors from scratch

1. Create a vector of the participant data called `participant` using the `c()` function.

```{r}
participant <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
```

2. Now, create the `participant` vector again, but this time use the `a:b` function.

```{r}
participant <- 1:12
```

3. Now create the `participant` vector again! But this time use the `seq()` function. 

```{r}
participant <- seq(from = 1, to = 12, by = 1)
```

4. Create a vector of the before drink data called `before` using `c()`.

```{r}
before <- c(45, 49, 40, 48, 44, 70, 90, 75, 80, 65, 80, 52)
```

5. Create a vector of the after drink data called `after` using `c()`.

```{r}
after <- c(43, 50, 61, 44, 45, 20, 85, 65, 72, 65, 70, 75)
```

6. Create a vector of the age data called `age` using `c()`.

```{r}
age <- c(20, 19, 22, 20, 27, 22, 22, 20, 25, 22, 24, 22)
```

7. Create a vector of the sex data called `sex` but don't use `c()`. Instead, use the `rep()` function by looking for a pattern in the data.

```{r}
sex <- rep(c("male", "female"), length.out = 12)
# OR
sex <- rep(c("male", "female"), times = 6)
```

8. Create a vector of the eye color data called `eye.color` but don't use `c()`. Instead, use the `rep()` function by looking for the pattern in the data.

```{r}
# Here are different methods:
eye.color <- rep(c("blue", "brown"), each = 2, times = 3)
eye.color <- rep(c("blue", "brown"), each = 2, length.out = 12)
eye.color <- rep(c("blue", "blue", "brown", "brown"), times = 3)
```

## Combining and changing vectors

9. Create a new vector called `age.years` that shows the participants' age in months instead of years. (Hint: use basic vector arithmetic)

```{r}
# Note: I probably should have called this age.months...
age.years <- age * 12
```

10. Create a new vector called `change` that shows the change in participants' scores from before to after (Hint: use basic vector arithmetic)

```{r}
change <- after - before
```


11. Create a new vector called `average` that shows the participants' *average* score across both tests. That is, the first element of `average` should be the average of the first participant's two scores, and the second element should be the average of the second participant's two scores...(Hint: Don't use `mean()`! Use basic vector arithmetic)

```{r}
average <- (after + before) / 2
```

12. Oops! It turns out that the watch used to measure time was off. All the before times are 1 second too fast, and all the after times are 1 second too slow. Correct them!

```{r}
before <- before + 1
after <- after - 1
```

## Applying functions to vectors

13. How many elements are in *each* of the original data vectors? (Hint: use `length()`). If the number of elements in each is not the same, you typed something in wrong!

```{r}
length(participant)
length(before)
length(after)
length(age)
length(sex)
length(eye.color)
```

14. What was the standard deviation of ages? Assign the result to a scaler object called `age.sd`.

```{r}
age.sd <- sd(age)
```


15. What is the median age? Assign the result to a scaler object called `age.median`.

```{r}
age.median <- median(age)
```


16. How many people were there of each sex? (Hint: use `table()`)

```{r}
table(sex)
```


17. What percent of people had each sex? (Hint: use `table()` then divide by its sum with `sum()`)

```{r}
table(sex) / sum(table(sex))

# OR

table(sex) / length(sex)
```

18. Calculate the mean of the `sex` column. What happens and why?

```{r}
# We get an NA because sex is not a numeric vector!
mean(sex)
```


19. What was the mean `before` time? Assign the result to a scaler object called `before.mean`.

```{r}
before.mean <- mean(before)
```


20. What was the mean `after` time? Assign the result to a scaler object called `after.mean`.
```{r}
after.mean <- mean(after)
```


21. What was the difference in the mean `before` times and the mean `after` times? Calculate this in two ways: once using the `change` vector, and once using the `before.mean` and `after.mean` objects. You should get the same answer for both!

```{r}
after.mean - before.mean

# We have to create the change vector again because we updated after and before!
change <- after - before
mean(change)
```



# CHECKPOINT!

*If you got this far you are doing just fine! Keep it up!*

## Standardizing (z-scores) vectors

22. Create a vector called `before.z` showing a standardized version of `before`.

```{r}
before.z <- (before - mean(before)) / sd(before)
```


23. Create a vector called `after.z` showing a standardized version of `after`.

```{r}
after.z <- (after - mean(after)) / sd(after)
```


24. What was the largest `before` score? What was its corresponding z-score?

```{r}
max(before)
max(before.z)
```


25. What was the smallest `after` score? What was its corresponding z-score?

```{r}
min(after)
min(after.z)
```


26. What should the mean and standard deviation of `before.z` and `after.z` be? Test your predictions by making the appropriate calculations.

```{r}
# The mean should be 0 the sd should be 1!

mean(before.z)
sd(before.z)

mean(after.z)
sd(after.z)
```


## Random samples from distributions

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, eval = FALSE}
# A Histogram of 10,000 samples from a Normal distribution with Mean = 100 and sd = 10
hist(rnorm(10000, mean = 100, sd = 10), 
     main = "N(Mean = 100, SD = 10)", yaxt = "n", 
     xlab = "", col = "wheat2", border = "white", 
     xlim = c(50, 150), ylab = "")

```


You can create random samples of values from a Normal distribution using the `rnorm(n, mean, sd)` function. For example, the following code chunk will save a vector of 50 values from a Normal distribution with mean of 20 and standard deviation of 10

```{r}
# Random sample of 50 values from N(mean = 20, sd = 10)
x <- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 20, sd = 10)
```

27. Create a vector called `samp.10` that contains 10 samples from a Normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10.

```{r}
samp.10 <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 100, sd = 10)
```

28. Create a vector called `samp.100000` that contains 100,000 samples from the same Normal distribution as above (that is, also with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 10).

```{r}
samp.100000 <- rnorm(n = 100000, mean = 100, sd = 10)
```

29. Before making any calculations, what would you guess the mean and standard deviations of `samp.10` and `samp.100000` are? Which prediction are you more confident in?

```{r}
# My best guess for both means is 100 and for both sds is 10.
#  However I'm more confident in samp.100000 because the sample size
#   is larger!
```


30. Calculate the mean and standard deviations of `samp.10` and `samp.100000` separately. Was your prediction correct?

```{r}
mean(samp.10)
sd(samp.10)

mean(samp.100000)
sd(samp.100000)

# Yes my prediction was correct! (at least for this sample...)
```


## The Room with 100 Boxes

Imagine the following. There is a room with 100 boxes. 99 of the 100 boxes each contain 100,000 EUR which you can keep. 1 of the 100 boxes contains a bomb which kills you if you open it.

Here's the question...if you walked into the room with 100 boxes, how many would you want to open?

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, echo = FALSE}
# Plot of the Boxes Game

# Plotting space
plot(1, xlim = c(0, 11), ylim = c(0, 11),
     xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "The 100 Boxes Game!", 
     type = "n", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n")

text(x = 5.5, y = 11, labels = "There are 100 boxes\n99 / 100 contain 10,000 EUR (each) and 1 / 100 contains a bomb! How many will you open?", font = 3, cex = .8)

# Boxes
points(x = rep(1:10, times = 10), y = rep(1:10, each = 10), 
    pch = 22, cex = 4, 
     bg = sample(c(rep("green", 99), "red")))

# Labels
points(x = rep(1:10, times = 10), y = rep(1:10, each = 10), pch = "?")

```


You can easily play the Room with 100 Boxes game using the `sample` function in R.

First, put the number of boxes you want to open as a new scaler object called `i.will.open`:

```{r}
i.will.open <- 0  # How many do you want to open? Change the value from 0 to your number
```

Now run the following code to see what you get!

```{r eval = F}
# Play the Room with 100 Boxes Game!

boxes.result <- sample(x = c(rep(100000, 99), -Inf),  # Sample from the box...
                 size = i.will.open)

# Print what you got!

boxes.result  # Show what's in each box (1 means 10,000 EUR)
sum(boxes.result)  # Your total winnings!
```

You can also represent the boxes game with a custom function in R. Run the following chunk to create the new function `play.boxes.game`:

```{r}
# Run this chunk to create the function
play.boxes.game <- function(i.will.open) {

# Prevents exponent printing  
options("scipen" = 100, "digits" = 4)
  
if(i.will.open == 0) {
  
  print("You didn't open any boxes! You earned nothing but are still alive")}
  
if(i.will.open > 0) {
  
  boxes.result <- sample(x = c(rep(100000, 99), -Inf),
                   size = i.will.open)

if(-Inf %in% boxes.result) {
  
  print(paste("You're dead!!! You opened ", i.will.open, 
              " boxes and got the bomb!!!", sep = ""))}

if((-Inf %in% boxes.result) == FALSE) {
  
  print(paste("Congratulations!!! You opened ", i.will.open, 
              " boxes and earned ", sum(boxes.result), 
              " Euros! Don't you want to play again? :)", sep = ""))}
}
  
}
```

Now play the game just by running the function with the number of boxes you want to open as the main argument! For example...

```{r}
play.boxes.game(0)  # Play with 0 boxes
```
