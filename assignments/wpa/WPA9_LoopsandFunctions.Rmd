In this WPA, you will analyze data from a (again...fake) study on attraction. In the study, 1000 heterosexual University students viewed the Facebook profile of another student (the "target") of the opposite sex. Based on a target's profile, each participant made three judgments about the target - intelligence, attractiveness, and dateability. The primary judgement was a *dateability* rating indicating how dateable the person was on a scale of 0 to 100.

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
facebook <- read.table("http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
```


The data are located in a tab-delimited text file at http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook.txt. Here is how the first few rows of the data should look:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
head(facebook)
```

## Datafile description

The data file has 1000 rows and 10 columns. Here are the columns

- `session`: The experiment session in which the study was run. There were 50 total sessions.

- `sex`: The sex of the target

- `age`: The age of the target

- `haircolor`: The haircolor of the target

- `university`: The university that the target attended.

- `education`: The highest level of education obtained by the target.

- `shirtless`: Did the target have a shirtless profile picture? 1.No v 2.Yes

- `intelligence`: How intelligent do you find this target? 1.Low, 2.Medium, 3.High

- `attractiveness`: How physically attractive do you find this target? 1.Low, 2.Medium, 3.High

- `dateability`: How dateable is this target? 0 to 100.

## Data loading and preparation

1. Open your class R project. Open a new script and enter your name, date, and the wpa number at the top. Save the script in the `R` folder in your project working directory as `wpa_9_LASTFIRST.R`, where LAST and FIRST are your last and first names. 

2. The data are stored in a tab--delimited text file located at http://nathanieldphillips.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/facebook.txt. Using `read.table()` load this data into R as a new object called `facebook`

## Understand the data

3. Look at the first few rows of the dataframe with the `head()` function to make sure it loaded correctly.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
head(facebook)
```

4. Using the `str()` function, look at the structure of the dataframe to make sure everything looks ok

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
str(facebook)
```

## Custom Functions

5. Write a function called `feed.me()` that takes a string `food` as an argument, and returns the sentence "I love to eat ___". Try your function by running `feed.me("apples")`.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
feed.me <- function(___) {
  
  output <- paste0("I love to eat ", ___)
  
  print(___)
}
```

6. Write a function called `my.mean()` that takes a vector `x` as an argument, and returns the mean of the vector `x`. Don't use the `mean()` function! Use `sum()` and `length()`!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
my.mean <- function(___) {
  
  result <- sum(___) / length(___)
  
  return(result)
  
}
```

7. Try your `my.mean()` function to calculate the mean dateability rating of participants in the `facebook` dataset and compare the result to the built-in `mean()` function to make sure you get the same result!

8. Write a function called `how.many.na()` that takes a vector `x` as an argument, and returns the number of NA values found in the vector:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
how.many.na <- function(x) {
  
  output <- sum(is.na(___))
  
  return(___)
}
```

9. Test your `how.many.na()` function on the age of participants in the `facebook` dataframe and then on the vector `x = c(4, 7, 3, NA, NA, 1)`


10. Create a function called `my.plot()` that takes arguments `x` and `y` and returns a customised scatterplot with gridlines and a regression line:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
my.plot <- function(x, y) {
  
  plot(x = ___, 
       y = ___, 
       pch = ___,     # look at ?points to see the values of pch!
       col = ___)
  
  grid()   # Add gridlines
  
  # Add a regression line
  abline(lm(___ ~ ___), 
         col = ___)
}
```

11. Now test your `my.plot()` function on the age and dateability of participants in the `facebook` dataset

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
my.plot <- function(x, y) {
  
  plot(x = x, 
       y = y, 
       pch = 16,     # look at ?points to see the values of pch!
       col = "green")
  
  grid()   # Add gridlines
  
  # Add a regression line
  abline(lm(y ~ x), 
         col = "blue")
}
```

## Loops

12. Create a loop that prints the squares of integers from 1 to 10:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
for(i in ___) {
  
  square.i <- ___
  
  print(square.i)
  
}
```


13. Using the following template, create a loop that calculates (and prints) the mean dateability rating of students from each university in the `facebook` dataset

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
for(university.i in c("1.Basel", "2.Zurich", "3.Geneva")) {
  
  data.i <- facebook$dateability[facebook$university == ___]
  
  output <- paste0("The mean dateability of university ", ___, " is ", ___)
  
  print(___)
  
}
```


14. Now create a histogram of dateability ratings from each level of intelligence using the following structure

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3)) # Set up 1 x 3 plotting grid

for(intelligence.i in c("1.low", "2.medium", "3.high")) {
  
  hist(facebook$dateability[facebook$intelligence == ___],
       main = ___,
       xlab = ___,
       col = ___
       )
  
}

par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # Reset plotting grid
```

# CHECKPOINT!

# More functions!

15. Write a function called `ttest.apa()` that takes a vector `x` as an argument and returns an apa style conclusion from a one-sample test of `x`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ttest.apa <- function(x, mu) {
  
   # Store the one-sample ttest in object a
  
  a <- t.test(x = ___, 
              mu = ___) 
  
  df <- a$parameter  # Get the degrees of freedom
  test.stat <- ___      # Get the test statistic
  p.value <- ___        # Get the p-value
  
  
  # If the test is significant...
  if(p.value <= ___) {
    
    output <- paste0("The test is significant! t(",
                     df, ") = ", test.stat, 
                   ", p = ", p.value, 
                   " (H0 = ", mu, ")")
  }
  
  # If the test is not significant...
    if(p.value > ___) {
    
    output <- ___
    
  }
  
  print(___)  
}
```

16. Test your `ttest.apa()` function on the the dateability of participants in the facebook study. Specifically, test if their mean dateability rating is different from 50


# More loops!


17. The following dataframe `survey` contains results from a survey of 5 participants. Each participant was asked 5 questions on a 1-10 likert scale. As you can see, many of the responses are not valid integers from 1-10. Using a loop, create a new dataframe called `survey.corrected` that converts all invalid values to NA:

```{r}
survey <- data.frame("p" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
                     "q1" = c(5, 3, 6, 3, 5),
                     "q2" = c(-1, 4, 3, 6, 11),
                     "q3" = c(6, 22, 4, 6, -5),
                     "q4" = c(6, 3, 4, -2, 4),
                     "q5" = c(1, 1, 900, 1, 2))
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
survey.corrected <- survey   # COPY SURVEY

for(column.i in ____ ) {  # LOOP OVER COLUMNS
 
  x <- ____   # COPY THE ORIGINAL COLUMN as x
  x[(x %in% ___) == FALSE] <- ___  # REPLACE
  
  survey.corrected[,___] <- ___ # ASSIGN x back to survey.correced
  
}
```



# Simulation!

18. What is the probability of getting a significant p-value if the null hypothesis is true? Test this by conducting the following simulation:

  - Create a vector called `p.values` with 100 NA values. 
  - Draw a sample of size 10 from a normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.
  - Do a one-sample t-test testing if the mean of the distribution is different from 0. Save the p-value from this test in the 1st position of `p.values`.
  - Repeat these steps with a loop to fill `p.values` with 100 p-values.
  - Create a histogram of `p.values` and calculate the proportion of `p-values` that are significant at the .05 level.
  
```{r eval = FALSE}
p.values <- rep(NA, ___)

for(i in ___) {

x <- rnorm(n = ___, mean = ___, sd = ___)

result <- t.test(___)$___

p.values[___] <- ___

}
```
  
  
19. Create a function called `psimulation` with 4 arguments: `sim`: the number of simulations, `samplesize`: the sample size, `mu.true`: the true mean, and `sd.true`: the true standard deviation. Your function should repeat the simulation from the previous question with the given arguments. That is, it should calculate `sim` p-values testing whether `samplesize` samples from a normal distribution with mean = `mu.true` and standard deviation = `sd.true` is significantly different from 0. The function should return a vector of p-values.
