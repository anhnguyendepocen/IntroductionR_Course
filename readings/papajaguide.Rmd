In this document, we'll go over how to create APA style documents with Markdown and papaja. papaja (short for Preparing APA Journal Articles) is an R package that, combined with R Markdown, takes care of all the terribly tedious aspects of APA style, from layout to citations, and allows you to focus on your writing and analysis.

## Get the latest versions of RStudio and R

RStudio and R are constantly being updated with bug fixes and additional features. As of now, RStudio is at v1.0.44 and R is at version v3.3.2. If you have a version much older than these, I recommend you update them.

## Install TeX

In order to create PDF documents from papaja, you need to have a TeX distribution installed on your computer. Go to one of the following links and install the latest version to your computer.

- Windows: MikTeX https://miktex.org/
- Mac: MacTeX: http://www.tug.org/mactex/

**Note**: Be sure to restart RStudio after installing TeX to make sure RStudio knows it's there (now).

## Install papaja

Next, install the `papaja` R package from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the papaja R package from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")   # In case you don't have devtools installed
devtools::install_github("crsh/papaja")
library(papaja)
```

## Learn the basics of Markdown

`papaja` is based on R Markdown. R Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to easily construct all kinds of documents, from reports, to web pages, to APA style documents. For a full overview of R Markdown, go through the lessons at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html and check out the my guide at http://rpubs.com/YaRrr/markdownbasics

## Open an APA-template markdown file

Now it's time to write your APA style document using papaja! It's best to start by opening a template. Here are two templates I've created: 

1. A short APA style report: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndphillips/IntroductionR_Course/master/readings/phillips2017apa.Rmd. Here is the bibliography file `phillips2017apa_references.bib`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndphillips/IntroductionR_Course/master/readings/phillips2017apa_references.bib

2. An APA style tutorial on papaja: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndphillips/IntroductionR_Course/master/readings/apa_example.Rmd. Here is the bibliography file `r-references.bib`: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndphillips/IntroductionR_Course/master/readings/r-references.bib

You can also open the default APA template in Markdown by clicking the following in RStudio: File -- New File -- R Markdown... -- From Template -- APA Article (6th Edition)

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/ndphillips/IntroductionR_Course/blob/master/readings/papaja_ss1.png?raw=true")
```

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/ndphillips/IntroductionR_Course/blob/master/readings/papaja_ss2.png?raw=true")
```

When you click ok, you should see a new document like this open

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/ndphillips/IntroductionR_Course/blob/master/readings/papaja_ss3.png?raw=true")
```

## Update the main info

At the top of the document you'll see several entries that have to do with the basic information about the document, from the title, to the short-title (aka, the running header), to author names, and affiliations. Go ahead and update the entries in these fields to correspond to your paper.

## Add/update a bibtex file

In order to cite articles, you need to have a separate bibliography file called `references.bib` (or you can call it something else as long as it has the .bib ending). To create a new .bib file in RStudio, click File -- New File -- Text File. This should open a new blank file in RStudio. Now save the file as `references.bib`.

Your `references.bib` file must contain all of your references in BibTeX format. BibTeX format is just a way of defining an article's citation information (name, authors, year, journal etc.) in a standardized way. You need to add the BibTeX reference for *every* article you want to cite to your `references.bib` file. You can get BibTeX references easily from Google Scholar. To do this, go to scholar.google.com, and search for an article. When you find your article, click the "cite" button just under it. This will open up a citation window with many different citation styles. However, we don't want these, we want the BibTeX citation. To get this, click the BibTeX button. When you do, a new window will open with several lines of text starting with a header. For example, here is the BibTeX file for Kahneman & Tversky (1979)'s famous article on Prospect theory:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
@article{kahneman1979prospect,
  title={Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk},
  author={Kahneman, Daniel and Tversky, Amos},
  journal={Econometrica: Journal of the econometric society},
  pages={263--291},
  year={1979},
  publisher={JSTOR}
}
```


Now you need to add this BibTeX reference to your `references.bib` file. To do this, just copy the BibTeX reference from Google Scholar, and paste it into your `references.bib` file. Then save the file! Now that the BibTeX entry is saved in your `references.bib` file, you can reference this article in your paper!

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7618380/scholarbib.png")
```

Here is a screenshot of an example bibtex file. As you can see, it's just a collection of several BibTeX entries copied and pasted from google Scholar. You can see the original file here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7618380/r-references.bib.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7618380/bibtex_ss.png")
```

### Tell Markdown the name and location of your bibliography file!

You need to tell your Markdown file the name and location of your `references.bib` file for your citations to work. To do this, I recommend saving the `references.bib` file in the same folder as your .Rmd file. Then, make sure to update the name of the bibliography file in the appropriate field at the top of your `.Rmd` document. If you don't give the correct name of the bibliography file, or if it is saved in another location than the folder with your `.Rmd` document, your references and citations won't be included.

## Cite articles

To cite an article contained in your `bibliography.bib` file in your text, you need to know its title in your `references.bib` file. These titles are almost always in the format NameYearTitle and occur in the first line just after \@article{. Once you have a title, use the \@TITLE notation.  To cite a number of articles in parentheses, put \@TITLE in brackets. For example, in the following paragraph, I will cite a few papers using \@TITLE. 

Prospect theory, originally developed by @kahneman1979prospect, has been used to explain many real-world decisions [e.g.; @camerer2004prospect; @list2004neoclassical].

Once you cite an article using \@TITLE, the entire reference in APA style will automatically be added to the bibliography!

## Write!

Thankfully, papaja will take care of (almost) all of your APA formatting needs. Just focus on the basics. Create the main sections Method, Results, Discussion, using 1st level headers (\#), and subsections like Participants, Procedure with 2nd level headers (\##). Change font types to *italic* or **bold** with asterixes.

## Add R chunks

You add R chunks and inline code to a document using basic Markdown. Check out examples at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndphillips/IntroductionR_Course/master/readings/phillips2017apa.Rmd and the Markdown guide at http://rpubs.com/YaRrr/markdownbasics.

## Use papaja's helpful functions

papaja contains many helpful functions that will allow you to create apa style figures and tables. For example, the `apa_table()` function will format matrices and dataframes according to APA guidelines. 

### `apa.table()`

The `apa.table()` function will automatically convert a matrix or a dataframe to an APA style Table. For example, in the chunk below, I'll create a table of summary statistics and then print the results as an APA style table.

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = "asis", message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

# Calculate summary statistics
chicken.summary <- ChickWeight %>% group_by(Diet) %>%
  summarise(
    "Mean Weight" = mean(weight),
    "SD Weight" = sd(weight)
  )

# Print table in APA format

papaja::apa_table(chicken.summary, caption = "Summary statistics of chicken weights by Diet")
```

**Important!!!** To get your Table to be included in the final PDF, you need to include the `results='asis'` argument in the chunk options. If you don't do this, the table will be printed as commented LaTeX code in your final document. To be honest I'm not totally sure why you need to do this, I just learned it by trial-and-error.


### `apa.print()`

The `apa.print()` function will convert the results of a basic hypothesis test object (like a t-test or correlation test) to APA style output you can then use in an inline chunk. For example, in the following chunk I'll create a hypothesis test object:

```{r}
weight.aov <- aov(weight ~ Diet, data = ChickWeight)
```

Once you have a hypothesis test object, you can print specific results by running `papaja::apa_print(object)`. This function will return a list of different output formats. To see them all, run the function:

```{r}
papaja::apa_print(weight.aov)
```

In order to select a specific output format, select it by name using \$. For example, I can select the full result for the Diet factor by adding `$full_results$Diet` to the result. Together, I will use the following inline code: The ANOVA was significant `papaja::apa_print(weight.aov)$full_result$Diet`.

Here is the result!

The ANOVA was significant `r papaja::apa_print(weight.aov)$full_result$Diet`. 

## Knit the document!

To create a real APA document from your R Markdown file, you need to *knit* it. Knitting a document simply means converting R Markdown code to a formatted document (in our case, and APA formatted pdf document). You can knit a document by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your screen. Alternatively, you can use the Shift + Command + K hotkey on a Mac.

When you knit a document, you should see a bunch of processing code show up in your Console. This is totally normal. If everything is ok, then you should see your new APA style document show up in a new window! However, if there is an problem in your document, either in your R code or in your Markdown, you will see an error and the final document won't knit. The most common reason why your document won't knit is because you have an error in your R code.
